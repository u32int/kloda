# kloda: Knowledgable Logging Of Data (Altruistic)
kloda is an SCP:SL plugin for logging useful data and relaying it to a discord channel via [webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

**Features**:
 - Webhook event logging, namely:
   - Teamkilling, dealing damage to teammates, killing handcuffed players
   - [TODO] Ban logs
  - [TODO] In-game staff notifications
  - Warnings optionally broadcasted to offending players

## Docs
The full list of config options and valid template arguments can be found in: [DOCS.md](DOCS.md)

## Development/Contributing
I am open to accept pull requests/issues. 
I personally have _very_ little experience with csharp and its ecosystem, this project being literally the first thing I've ever built with it (I do, however, have a decent amount of experience with other languages :]). Please keep that in mind.
For more details and the development setup required to build this thing, refer to: [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)
